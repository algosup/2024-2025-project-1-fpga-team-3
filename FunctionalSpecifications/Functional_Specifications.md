# II) INTRO OF THE PROJECT:
### 1) ORIGINAL FROGGER DEFINITION

 Frogger is a 1981 arcade action game developed by Konami and published by Sega. In North America, it was distributed by Sega/Gremlin. The object of the game is to direct five frogs to their homes by dodging traffic on a busy road, then crossing a river by jumping on floating logs and alligators. 

### 2)Features of the game (original) Including pics
#### A) Objective in the game
 Make five frogs crossing the road, and the river to their home whiout getting run over or drowned in the river. 

# III) PROJECT REQUIREMENT 
## 1)PROJECT OVERVIEW
* Making a Frogger Clone game
* Using FPGA
* Has to work on a Go_Board Chip
* Creating a working game with 
## 2)PROJECT OBJECTIVES
* Creating a working frogger using the Go_Board.
* Including differents features that are accurate to the game, that can run on a VGA display output.
* On the Go_Board: the level number displayed on the two digits LED pannel 
*  A score counter displayed on screen top right.
## 3)FOCUS ON

| Focusing on |
|---|
| Delivering a clone of Frogger that works on the Go_Board Chip, and displayed on VGA output |
| Must be programed with FPGA on the Go_Board |

| Out of focus |
|---|
| Re-Doing the frogger maps |
| Multiplayer (2 players as original) |
| Advanced decoration |
| Frog Animations |

 We are just focusing on the features that replicate the original gameplay. We might add some features that the team want to add.
## 4)RESTRICTION OF THE PROJECT
 The level is not randomised but based on differents spawn points to create the illusion of a randomised map. We wont include different landscape such as the river and its content. We wont include any decoration of the map in the game. The cars will be in 7 by 8 bits while the frog will be 8 by 8bits.
