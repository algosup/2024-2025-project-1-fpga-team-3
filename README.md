# 2024-2025-project-1-fpga-team-3

## Project Description

For our First project of this year, we are recreating the famous game "FROGGER" made by Sega in 1981. Using Nandland's Go_Board, we have to create a version of the Frogger supported on this chipset, only using FPGA.

## Key Features

Our game includes the following features:

- **Score count**: Users score is registered in game and displayed on screen. üïπÔ∏è
- **Customs sprites**: Sprites of the game are customised, our team recreated them using the same dimensions. üê∏
- **Accurate gameplay**: Users will have a similar game experience as if they were playing the real frogger. üéÆ
- **Customs UI**: User interface will be made by our team with working features such as play buttons and more. üíª

## Technologies Used

- **[Verilog]**:Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It is most commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits.
- **[Visual Studio Code]**: Hardware that supports most of the languages used. We coded in visual code studio for this project.
- **[FPGA]**: A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a type of configurable integrated circuit that can be repeatedly programmed. FPGAs are a subset of logic devices referred to as programmable logic devices (PLDs). They consist of an array of programmable logic blocks with a connecting grid, that can be configured "in the field" to interconnect with other logic blocks to perform various digital functions.
- **[Go Board]**: The Go_Board is the chipset used to display our game. It features the Lattice ICE40 HX1K FPGA, EASY USB Connection for power, communication, and programming; Four User Settable LEDs, Four Push-Buttons / Dual / 7-Segment LED Display. A VGA Connector / External Connector (PMOD) / 25 MHz on-board clock / 1 Mb Flash for booting up your FPGA.

### Dependencies Version

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: 1.94.1

## Credentials

No specific credentials are needed to test the game.

## Device Tested

The game has been tested on the following devices:

- External Devices
  - Windows 11
  - MacOS Sequoia 15.0.1
